## API Test Report

This report summarizes the status of the API endpoints based on `curl` tests.

### Successful Endpoints:

-   **`/api/test` (GET):** This temporary route successfully returned "API route is working!". This confirms that the `routes/api.php` file is being loaded and that the API routing is generally functional.
-   **`/api/register` (POST):** Successfully registered a new user and returned an `access_token`.
-   **`/api/login` (POST):** Successfully logged in a user and returned an `access_token`.
-   **`/api/forms` (GET):** Successfully returned an empty array `[]` (expected, as no forms have been created yet) when authenticated with a bearer token.
-   **`/api/logout` (POST):** Successfully logged out the user.

### Failing Endpoints:

None. All tested API endpoints are now working as expected.

### Current Limitations:

None. All core authentication and API endpoints are now functional.

### Next Steps for Debugging (if needed):

-   None. The primary blocking issue has been resolved.
